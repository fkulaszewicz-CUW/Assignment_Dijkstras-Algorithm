# Assignment_Dijkstras-Algorithm
 
Step 1: Implement an example of  Dijkstra’s Algorithm as described in the panels above.

        You can represent your graph and its edge values in whatever way you want. 
        This assignment is focusing on the algorithm itself and not the underlying data structures. 
        In the ideal world, the algorithm is applied to a Graph Data Structure that represents all of the nodes and the connecting weights, but you can represent the graph’s data however you want.

Step 2: Your program should allow you to ask for the starting node and the ending node and it should give you the cost of the shortest path along with the path of the lowest cost as output. 

Step 3: You can hard code your graph data in your code if you want, or you can ask the user for it
